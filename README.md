**Why Learn Computer Vision in Python using OpenCV?**

**Computer vision applications and technology are exploding right now!** With several apps and industries making amazing use of the technology, from billion-dollar apps such as Pokémon GO, Snapchat and up and coming apps like MSQRD and PRISMA.

Even Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla are all heavily utilizing computer vision for face & object recognition, image searching and especially in Self-Driving Cars!

As a result, the  **demand for computer vision expertise is growing exponentially!**

However, learning **computer vision is hard!**  Existing online tutorials, textbooks, and free MOOCs are often  **outdated**, using older incompatible libraries or are **too theoretical**, making it difficult to understand.

This was my problem when learning Computer Vision and it became incredibly frustrating. Even simply running example code I found online proved difficult as libraries and functions were often outdated.

I created this course to teach you all the key concepts without the heavy mathematical theory while using the most up to date methods.

I take a very practical approach, using more than **50 Code Examples.**

At the end of the course, you will be able to build **12 Awesome Computer Vision Apps**  using OpenCV in Python.  

I use  **OpenCV** which is the most well supported open-source computer vision library that exists today! Using it in Python is just fantastic as Python allows us to focus on the problem at hand without being bogged down by complex code.

If you're an academic or college student I still point you in the right direction if you wish to learn more by linking the research papers of techniques we use.

So if you want to get an excellent foundation in Computer Vision, look no further.

**This is the course for you!**
